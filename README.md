# Problem Statement
The problem statement here is to analyze a dataset of covid cases worldwide and give real-time numbers for various regions. The dataset here has nine variables of different data types. The Covid-19 pandemic has taken the world for a toss. With so many infections worldwide, it became extremely difficult for the government to measure the intensity of the pandemic. But with analytics and Tableau, various analysts were able to get government verified data and use them to show the real picture of the world. The above dataset is an ideal example of how you can use Tableau to visualize such volumes of data based on categorical or numerical data.
